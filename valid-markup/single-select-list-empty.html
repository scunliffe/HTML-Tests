	<select style="min-width: 150px"></select>
	<p>Both of the select list elements above are empty.
	<br/>The rendering in Internet Explorer (and now Edge) is very quirky.
	I can only pressume that this is a legacy hold over from the way that native Windows combo box elements originally rendered.</p>
